    As an Open Source project, Wifi Fixer depends on you to help make it better.&nbsp; <br>
    Constructive feedback, ideas, and problem reports are always
    appreciated.&nbsp; When emailing the developer, please try to be
    specific and descriptive.<br><br>
    Wifi Fixer has a logging feature which lets you send diagnostic logs
    directly to the developer with one tap.&nbsp; The log's contents are
    helpful in diagnosing issues you might have.<br>
    Logging controls are available in Wifi Fixer's preferences as one of the categories. <br>
    The log file is stored in your sdcard under
    /Android/data/org.wahtod.wififixer/files/wififixer_log.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some older devices may put the file in a different location. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The log's data is a recording of what wifi and
    Wifi Fixer's Service are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The service must be turned on to capture data
    to the log. <br>
    <br>Since version 0.9.0, Wifi Fixer has recorded stack traces from crashes.&nbsp; <br>
    If you get a force close,&nbsp; tap Send Log to send the stack trace to the developer. <br>
    Stack traces contain no personal information of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
