<Project>
Functional set of heuristics and workarounds for Android wifi. 
Designed to use as few resources on the user's device as possible. 

<Developers>
Public Intents: 
/wififixer/src/org/wahtod/wififixer/IntentConstants.java

<Targets>
All Android devices 2.1 to 4.x with wifi and a touchscreen

<Why is it free?>
Because software which provides utility which should've been in the product it runs on to begin with should be free!

<Developer>
I like developing for Android.  Hope it shows.   


Alpha: 1.0 Velociraptor Vanquisher

***This is not release code.  It may explode your device and kill you***

1.0 will mark a design refresh for "Holo" with additional user-facing features and improvements, bugfixes, and lower memory consumption/fewer wakelocks.

Currently ActionBarSherlock is not integrated so only Android >= API11 is working
