    interruption in your connection during repair. Wifi Fixer may also
    toggle wifi to reset the supplicant to a working state</b>.</font><br>
<font color="white"><br>Wifi Fixer monitors your data connection to a
    wifi network.&nbsp; It does not fix signal or prevent disconnections,
    as this is not possible to do in an app.&nbsp; It does, however,
    respond to detected problems and attempt to repair them. <br>
    <br>
    Wifi Fixer keeps your connection healthy by checking periodically to see if data is passing
    through the wifi network.<br>
    <br>
    If the signal is bad, or if there's a connection problem, Wifi Fixer will attempt to find a
    known network with a better signal.<br>
    <br>
    If there isn't a better network, Wifi Fixer will attempt to repair the connection.<br>
    <br>
    In some cases, it can take several seconds to repair.<br>
    <br>When you are out of range of a known network, Wifi Fixer monitors
    scans until a known network is found, then&nbsp; attempts to connect.<br>
    <br>
    It can take several seconds for Wifi Fixer to connect to a known network which comes into range.<br>
    <br>
    If it can't connect, Wifi Fixer resets Wifi, then attempts to connect again.<br>
    <br>
    In those instances where Wifi Fixer is unable to recover the
    connection, manually toggle Wifi or use the widget in wifi toggle mode.<br>
